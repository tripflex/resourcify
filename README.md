Resourcify
==========

Resourcify is a Wordpress Plugin that will allow you to add Sources, Resources, and Quote Sources to a post.

Simply put, it gives you an interface on the post admin area to add a Title and URL for each Resource.  The plugin will then output those resources at the bottom of a single blog post page using either the default, or a custom defined template.  Template is rendered using Handlebars, and allows you to specify exactly how you want the output to look (html wise, css coming soon).


When creating a new post, below the content box you will see something similar to this:

## Post Metabox

## Template Editor

## Sample of output on a single post page

This plugin is still under development but hopefully soon will support (and include) a lot more features and customization.
