Resourcify
==========

Resourcify is a Wordpress Plugin that will allow you to add Sources, Resources, and Quote Sources to a post.

Simply put, it gives you an interface on the post admin area to add a Title and URL for each Resource.  The plugin will then output those resources at the bottom of a single post page using standard html `<ul>` and `<li>` tags.


When creating a new post, below the content box you will see something similar to this:

## Post Metabox

This first release version is very simple and does allow you to select "Source", "Resource", or "Quote", but right now this is only for future support of these categories.  Currently the plugin only outputs the items as you can see below, but soon will include formatting and more styles to choose from.

This plugin is still under development but hopefully soon will support (and include) a lot more features and customization.
