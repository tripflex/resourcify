Add sources to posts via metabox and output below post using template generated with handlebars.  Very clean and completely customizable.

== Description ==

Resourcify allows you to add Sources, Resources, and Quote Sources to a post and display those links at the bottom of each post.

Simply put, it gives you an interface on the post admin area to add a Title and URL for each Resource.  The plugin will then output those resources at the bottom of a single blog post page using either the default, or a custom defined template.  Template is rendered using Handlebars, and allows you to specify exactly how you want the output to look (html wise, css coming soon).

= Features =

* Output standard HTML links to sources
